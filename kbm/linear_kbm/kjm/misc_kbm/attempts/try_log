Keeping track of different attempts of KBM simulations - attempting to reproduce linear results from Aleynikova 2018

#---------------> First try

- reran full KBM simulation (all beta values - 4 gist files)

#---------------> Second try

- simulated first and last set of beta values (lowest and highest beta sets - first and last gist file)
- used higher nkxo (3 -> 15)

#---------------> Third try

- only simulated last set of beta values (highest beta set - final gist file)
- used increased nkx0 resolution and hyp_z (15 and 8?)

#---------------> Fourth try 
#*** Can ignore: not likely to find KBMs at this kyrho ***

- holding kyrho constant at 0.8
- only simulated last set of beta values (highest beta set - final gist file)
- used increased nkx0, nv0, and hyp_z (15, 96 & 8)

#---------------> Fifth try

- using gist file corresponding to beta_equil=0
- scan over beta_kinetic=[0%, 3%]
- scanned for kyrho=0.1,0.8
